LTD.,"Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Unscrambl was founded with the vision of helping organizations take the best possible decisions given the most up-to-date knowledge about the current state of the world and how it will respond to the actions. While Big Data has been instrumental in helping organizations gain a better understanding of their world, not many organizations have been able to successfully translate that understanding to optimal actions that can drive their business objectives.
This failure to easily harness Big Data, to drive actionable insights and to execute actions in a changing world in real-time spurred the Unscrambl team to come up with a better approach. There were a few key realizations. The first is that analytics and actions had to be industry and use-case specific to allow easy adoption and execution. The second is that real-time matters: the quicker you are to act, the quicker you are to succeed, or fail. And the third is that the world is always changing, so we need to be able to observe the effect of our actions, continuously update our model of the world and continuously evolve our decisions and strategies.
With the help of these realizations, we have come up with a kit of solutions that can be implemented blazing fast so data-driven businesses would neither lose their competitive edge nor their customers and that are forever adapting and learning as the world changes.
All these solutions are powered by a real-time cognitive decisioning platform that utilizes stream analytics, machine learning and decision theory to tackle numerous use-cases across different industries. Specifically, we have come up with the concept of “Robots”, which are automated engines that can drive business outcomes by sensing the current state of the world, deciding and executing the best actions, observing the effects of the actions, and using the feedback to update their model of the world.

Back in 1999, six entrepreneurs became bored of big agency politics and frustrated by bureaucracy.
They decided to create a new kind of agency. One that could innovate around client needs and, in turn, help clients to innovate around business and consumer needs.
Today Iris is a diverse, thriving creative network. Our 1,000 people across 14 offices work with some of the most adventurous and successful clients in the world.
Our ambition is to be the most inspiring and innovative agency network on the planet.
We are built for today's challenges
89% of advertising is not noticed or remembered.
3 out of 4 brands are failing to build emotional engagement.
Today’s consumer is able to live within their own networks, on their own terms. And if they’re not ignoring you, they’re actively blocking you. Brands no longer influence people. People do.
We build Participation Brands
A new breed of brand has become more ingrained in people’s lives than ever before.
By actively enhancing lifestyles, passion points and popular culture they get their market doing their marketing.
They are Participation Brands.
And we’ve been building them for 18 years.
We are all about the blend
At Iris we have no dominant ‘discipline gene’, no departmental silos and no personal ego.
Just a diverse array of specialists operating in a no borders, no boundaries, no bullshit environment.
Our emphasis on ‘The Blend’ means we’re constantly mixing and matching talent to create the right integrated team on each project.
We are part of something bigger
Iris is part of Cheil Worldwide - the world’s 15th biggest agency company with a network of 55 offices and over 5,000 people.
Our partnership with Cheil provides Iris with an extensive global reach, breadth of skill sets, people and technology.

Working in 90+ countries around the world, we serve all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender.   World Vision Singapore History In May 1975, the South Vietnamese city of Saigon fell to Communist forces. This led to a flood of refugees streaming into Thailand by land, and by May 1977, triggered the flight of people by sea.   Masses started landing in neighbouring Southeast Asian countries by boat. Many perished in stormy seas and attacks by unfriendly forces. The plight of the “Boat People” prompted World Vision to begin Operation Seasweep in May 1978. A 345-tonne converted landing craft was chartered to sail in the South China Sea to aid the boat people. This was replaced by a 1,500-tonne freighter with facilities for a medical crew, mechanics and interpreters in July 1979. The efforts of World Vision to save the Vietnamese boat people led to the establishment of a field operation in Singapore in the late 1970s.   This task expanded in 1980 when World Vision began to assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in running a medical clinic at the Hawkins Road Refugee Camp in Sembawang. Towards the end of 1983, World Vision decided to run a full branch support office in Singapore. Personnel were recruited and in March 1984, the administration of World Vision’s Child Sponsorship Programme – which linked supporters in Singapore and Malaysia – was transferred from Hong Kong.

From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link. 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named LUCIDITY. For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the LUCIDITY trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5

By 2008, through partnership with most major chain stores, distributors, hypermarkets, departmental stores and themeparks in the region, the point of sales selling our products have exceed 10,000 locations. The Financial Crisis in 2008 did not really dampen the growth of Vision Empire, however it forced a revision on the strategies and direction of the company even we continues to aquire brands to continue the growth in the region. With the completion of Universal Studios Singapore in 2009 and our partnership, themepark business has been identified as one of the key growth area and thus the customized themepark business unit was formed. Our strong manufacturing origin as well as the expertise in managing licensed products in terms of design, prototpying, logistics and warehousing has proven to be invaluable in our partnership with various themeparks and clearly highlighted what other companies could not offer, a speedy reliablie dependable one-stop profesisonal service handled by an experienced team.  As we look into the near future where many countries in the region have begun to build world class themeparks , we are strategically located as well with the appropriate teams to service this growing market.
