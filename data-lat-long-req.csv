A research-intensive public university, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) has 33,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students in the colleges of Engineering, Business, Science, and Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, and its Interdisciplinary Graduate School. NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine was established jointly with Imperial College London.
Meteoric rise in international academic reputation ?
In 2018, NTU was placed 12th globally in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings. It was also ranked the world’s best young university (under 50 years old) by QS for the fifth consecutive year. In addition, NTU was named the world’s fastest rising young university by Times Higher Education in 2015.
In engineering and technology, NTU is ranked 5th worldwide in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018. With six schools, NTU’s College of Engineering is among the top nine globally for research output and the 5th most cited in the world (Essential Science Indicators 2017). ?
Mirroring this success is the College of Science, whose young chemistry department is ranked 10th among universities in the Nature Index 2018. Boosted by research at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, NTU is also strengthening its foothold in areas such as biomedicine and life sciences.
The well-established Nanyang Business School is regularly featured among the leading business schools in Asia, with its MBA programme consistently rated top in Singapore since 2004 by The Economist.
Innovative learning
In higher education, NTU is driving new pedagogies so that millennials can learn more effectively in this digital age. Part of NTU's education strategy is the flipped classroom model of learning. The centrepiece of this new way of learning is The Hive, a groundbreaking learning facility that has been described by CNN as having redefined the traditional classroom. 
Innovative education initiatives also include signature programmes such as Renaissance Engineering Programme, CN Yang Scholars Programme, NTU-University Scholars Programme. Designed for high-achieving students, these programmes offer a multidisciplinary curriculum, guidance by top faculty, interdisciplinary and intensive research opportunities, overseas exposure, as well as dialogues with world-class scientists and industry leaders.?
Set up jointly with Imperial College London, NTU's medical school, is grooming a new generation of doctors to meet the healthcare needs of Singapore.
Research impact
Known for research excellence and technological innovation, NTU leads the top Asian universities in normalised research citation impact (Clarivate Analytics’ InCites 2016). In the 2018 Nature Index, NTU is placed 29th among the world's universities and first in Singapore.
NTU's five-year strategic plan, NTU 2020, builds on strong foundations of NTU 2015 and aims to propel NTU to greater heights of research excellence. The plan focuses on five key research thrusts – Sustainable Earth, Global Asia, Secure Community, Healthy Society and Future Learning. The areas leverage NTU’s diverse strengths, particularly its longstanding expertise in engineering, business and education, and the interfaces these have with various disciplines such as in healthcare, science and the humanities. NTU’s sustainability initiatives have clinched significant competitive research funding and the university is already a global leader in this area.

Back in 1999, six entrepreneurs became bored of big agency politics and frustrated by bureaucracy.
They decided to create a new kind of agency. One that could innovate around client needs and, in turn, help clients to innovate around business and consumer needs.
Today Iris is a diverse, thriving creative network. Our 1,000 people across 14 offices work with some of the most adventurous and successful clients in the world.
Our ambition is to be the most inspiring and innovative agency network on the planet.
We are built for today's challenges
89% of advertising is not noticed or remembered.
3 out of 4 brands are failing to build emotional engagement.
Today’s consumer is able to live within their own networks, on their own terms. And if they’re not ignoring you, they’re actively blocking you. Brands no longer influence people. People do.
We build Participation Brands
A new breed of brand has become more ingrained in people’s lives than ever before.
By actively enhancing lifestyles, passion points and popular culture they get their market doing their marketing.
They are Participation Brands.
And we’ve been building them for 18 years.
We are all about the blend
At Iris we have no dominant ‘discipline gene’, no departmental silos and no personal ego.
Just a diverse array of specialists operating in a no borders, no boundaries, no bullshit environment.
Our emphasis on ‘The Blend’ means we’re constantly mixing and matching talent to create the right integrated team on each project.
We are part of something bigger
Iris is part of Cheil Worldwide - the world’s 15th biggest agency company with a network of 55 offices and over 5,000 people.
Our partnership with Cheil provides Iris with an extensive global reach, breadth of skill sets, people and technology.
And importantly, for our clients it means the experience of a smaller local agency with the resource of a large global one. We currently deliver global to local work for Diageo, Philips, Samsung, Shell and adidas.

Staff responsible for posting the discriminatory job advertisement had been reprimanded. And all staff had been reminded on the importance of Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices and to strictly adhere to the company’s standard operating procedure when posting job advertisement so as to avoid a repetition of such job advertisement.
Manpower Staffing Services (S) Pte Ltd was one of the early signatories of the Employer’s Pledge for Fair Employment Practices in the year 2007. We have also been and continue to support the fair employment practices in Singapore and wholeheartedly affirm the “Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices”. We give our assurance that the posting of discriminatory job advertisement will not happen again.
Once again, Manpower Staffing Services (S) Pte Ltd hereby affirms our commitment towards fair employment and pledges our support for the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.
Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link. 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named LUCIDITY. For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the LUCIDITY trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5
