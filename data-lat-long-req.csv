Together you and your team will work to build a stable and scalable data infrastructure that will be able to help the business to collect, process and store masses of raw information securely, accurately and efficiently. With all that information on hand, we’ll be looking to you to help us design and build amazing data products to improve user experiences on our Moneysmart sites as well as build up the business intelligence capabilities within our organization. We’re looking for someone who is experienced and has done similar work like this elsewhere before. You will be working closely with people from other departments like Product, Marketing and Strategy to help understand their needs and design solutions that will enable them to deliver on their goals. Examples of this could be:  Onboarding customer data from external systems so further analysis can be conducted on it and we can discover/better understand customer preferences and trends Building a recommendation engine that can recommend products based on user’s past choices, creating a more personalized and desirable experience Creating a near real time reporting platform so that the country managers can get information in a more timely manner to make decisions quickly  To be able to do all these, you’ll need to plan and manage the Data Team’s roadmap well and help prioritize the work that needs to be done so that we can see the awesome impact it could bring sooner rather than later. You will be expected to be technical as well. Being able to build data pipelines, write code and tune database queries will be a requirement since you’ll need to review and vet the work your team has done. The engineers will be looking to you to learn about best practices in building pipelines and running analysis, industry standards on data infrastructure and what clean, maintainable code looks like.

Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.

TransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission: Money without borders - so people and businesses can send and receive any currency effortlessly, whenever, wherever.
The heart of what we do is international money transfer. We’re committed to making it instant, convenient and fair for millions of people, all over the world. And we’re growing our other products and our teams at an exciting pace. And we’re looking for the very best to jump on board.
What it’s really like to work here
At TransferWise, we do things a bit differently. There’s no corporate nonsense, and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in dozens of self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up that learn from each other.
Each team picks the problems they want to solve. So there’s no micro-management. No hiding behind fancy job titles. And no one telling you what to do. You are your own boss. But you’ll get tons of guidance and plenty of support from talented, super-smart colleagues from all over TransferWise.
We’re going to be upfront — the way we work doesn’t suit everyone. But if freedom, autonomy, and life-affirming, head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.

From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link. 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named LUCIDITY. For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the LUCIDITY trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5
