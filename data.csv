LTD.,"Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Unscrambl was founded with the vision of helping organizations take the best possible decisions given the most up-to-date knowledge about the current state of the world and how it will respond to the actions. While Big Data has been instrumental in helping organizations gain a better understanding of their world, not many organizations have been able to successfully translate that understanding to optimal actions that can drive their business objectives.
This failure to easily harness Big Data, to drive actionable insights and to execute actions in a changing world in real-time spurred the Unscrambl team to come up with a better approach. There were a few key realizations. The first is that analytics and actions had to be industry and use-case specific to allow easy adoption and execution. The second is that real-time matters: the quicker you are to act, the quicker you are to succeed, or fail. And the third is that the world is always changing, so we need to be able to observe the effect of our actions, continuously update our model of the world and continuously evolve our decisions and strategies.
With the help of these realizations, we have come up with a kit of solutions that can be implemented blazing fast so data-driven businesses would neither lose their competitive edge nor their customers and that are forever adapting and learning as the world changes.
All these solutions are powered by a real-time cognitive decisioning platform that utilizes stream analytics, machine learning and decision theory to tackle numerous use-cases across different industries. Specifically, we have come up with the concept of “Robots”, which are automated engines that can drive business outcomes by sensing the current state of the world, deciding and executing the best actions, observing the effects of the actions, and using the feedback to update their model of the world.

Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.
Access to Expert IT Resources
Building a large, qualified team of internal IT staff to handle all of an enterprise’s needs is expensive and difficult. Using managed IT services ensures access to a complete team of IT experts.
Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.
Enhancing Your IT Compliance
Managed services for IT can help enterprises rapidly meet key governance and compliance requirements by handling critical security updates and other maintenance tasks.

Taiger is a global leader in cognitive automation for financial enterprises and other organisations, present on four continents. We build digital machines that are faster, better and cheaper than humans in certain work functions, or make humans vastly more productive in others. These are big, difficult problems which require equally audacious technical solutions. 
Traditional structured data is only a fraction of an organisation’s information; the vast majority of information is unstructured content: documents, reports, emails, survey forms, voice calls etc. Traditional machine learning approaches alone cannot solve for unstructured information. This requires something much more special.
Taiger fundamentally solves unstructured information access problems and transforms mere information into executable knowledge. Our product portfolio is based on a state-of-the-art AI solution architecture for reuse and agile integration.
Taiger has a deep expertise in combining 5 of the 7 forms of AI to help make financial institutions profitable again. This is technically achieved through the application of semantic and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, knowledge representation, perception and concept-extraction and multi-language ontology building skills, which no other product provider offers.
We undertake cutting edge research and apply the latest technical innovations to solve real problems.

Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.
Access to Expert IT Resources
Building a large, qualified team of internal IT staff to handle all of an enterprise’s needs is expensive and difficult. Using managed IT services ensures access to a complete team of IT experts.
Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.
Enhancing Your IT Compliance
Managed services for IT can help enterprises rapidly meet key governance and compliance requirements by handling critical security updates and other maintenance tasks.

From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link. 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named LUCIDITY. For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the LUCIDITY trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5
